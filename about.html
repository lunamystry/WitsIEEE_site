					The Wits student branch was established at the beginning of 2006. This was by Electrical engineering

					The founding members of the branch were Electrcial Engineering students. This meant that the IEEE 
					was over the years
					mainly with Electrical students. Starting this year the aim is to change that.

				<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
				<div class="entry">
				<p>
					The primary purpose of this Student Branch is to introduce students to the IEEE. 
					In order to achieve this, the Branch will inform students about the organisation 
					and its role in terms of a professional technical association. The Branch will 
					also assist potential student members with joining the IEEE. This involves 
					acting as an intermediary between the two parties so that students are able to 
					join with the confidence that their IEEE Student Branch committee is actively 
					looking-out for their interests.
					</br>
					</br>
					Further to the above, this branch also aims to follow the example of the IEEE 
					worldwide and to provide value to our members because they are part of our 
					professional organisation. To achieve this, the branch will utilise its 
					structure and available resources to provide students with benefits which 
					would not be available without the involvement of the Student Branch.
