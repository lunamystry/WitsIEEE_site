					<h3> > History </h3>
					The IEEE started out as the American Institude for Electrical Engineers (AIEE). This was started 
					by a group of Electrical proffesionals to help them apply their innovation for the betterment of 
					humanity. The Institute of Radio Engineers was later founded and modelled on the AIEE. The two 
					societies merged in 1963 to form the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). 
					</p>
					<p>
					The IEEE grew in the decades that followed and by the early 21st Century, IEEE served its members 
					and their interests with 38 societies; 130 journals, transactions and magazines; more 300 
					conferences annually; and 900 active standards. IEEE’s fields of interest expanded well beyond 
					electrical/electronic engineering and computing into areas such as micro- and nanotechnology, 
					ultrasonics, bioengineering, robotics, electronic materials, and many others.

				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Wits Student Branch</a></h2>
				<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

					<p>
					The Wits student branch was established at the beginning of 2006. This was by Electrical engineering
					students. The founding members were:
					
					The founding members of the branch were Electrcial Engineering students. This meant that the IEEE 
					was over the years
					mainly with Electrical students. Starting this year the aim is to change that.
					The branch currently has more than 90 members.
					It is part of R8.
					</p>
			  
					<h3><a href="#">Mission statement</a></h3>
				  <p>
					The primary purpose of this Student Branch is to introduce students to the IEEE. 
					In order to achieve this, the Branch will inform students about the organisation 
					and its role in terms of a professional technical association. The Branch will 
					also assist potential student members with joining the IEEE. This involves 
					acting as an intermediary between the two parties so that students are able to 
					join with the confidence that their IEEE Student Branch committee is actively 
					looking-out for their interests.
					</br>
					</br>
					Further to the above, this branch also aims to follow the example of the IEEE 
					worldwide and to provide value to our members because they are part of our 
					professional organisation. To achieve this, the branch will utilise its 
					structure and available resources to provide students with benefits which 
					would not be available without the involvement of the Student Branch.   
					</p>
				<h3 class="title"><a href="#">Membership</a></h3>
				<p>
					The Wits student Branch is proud to announce that membership 
					numbers in 2010 have already exceeded previous years. At the 
					start of May 2010, the current membership statistics are:
